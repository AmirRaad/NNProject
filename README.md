# Neural-Style-Transfer
A project that was made for the Neural Networks Lab, [Damascus University](http://www.damascusuniversity.edu.sy/index.php?lang=2).

## Overview
Neural style transfer (NST) is a technique that takes two images — a content image and a style reference image — and blends them together so that the output looks like the content image, but painted in the style of the style reference image.

The aim of this project is to understand how NST works by reconstructing the original paper on neural style transfer (Gatys et al.).
This repo contains a concise PyTorch implementation in Google Colab [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AmirRaad/Neural-Style-Transfer/blob/master/Project.ipynb) using the **optimization method**.
